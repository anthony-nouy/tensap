# tensap (Tensor Approximation Package)

A Python package for the approximation of functions and tensors.

tensap features low-rank tensors (including canonical, tensor-train and tree-based tensor formats or tree tensor networks), sparse tensors, polynomials, and allows the plug-in of other approximation tools. It provides different approximation methods based on interpolation, least-squares projection or statistical learning.

See the tutorials folder and its subfolders for examples of use.

Install from PyPi:

```
pip install tensap
```

Alternatively, you can install tensap directly from github:

```
pip install git+git://github.com/anthony-nouy/tensap@master
```
