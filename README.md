**tensap** is a Python package for the approximation of functions and tensors that features low-rank tensors (including canonical, tensor-train and tree-based tensor formats or tree tensor networks), sparse tensors, polynomials, and allows the plug-in of other approximation tools. It provides different approximation methods based on interpolation, least-squares projection or statistical learning.
