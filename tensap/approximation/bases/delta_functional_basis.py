    """
    Class DeltaFunctionalBasis.

    Basis of univariate functions defined on a finite set of values in R^d.

    The is_orthonormal attribute remains at its default value of False.

    Attributes
    ----------
    values : numpy.ndarray of shape (n,d)
        contains the set of n values taken by the argument of the functions.
    measure : tensap.Measure
        The measure associated with the basis, by default a DiscreteMeasure.
        Can be a tensap.RandomVector or a tensap.RandomVariable to define
        a random generator and an expectation.

    """

        """
        Constructor for the class DeltaFunctionalBasis.

        The basis is not L2-orthonormal a priori, hence the is_orthonormal
        attribute remains at its default value of False.

        Parameters
        ----------
        values : numpy.ndarray of shape (n,d)
            contains the set of n values taken by the argument of the functions.
            The default is None.
        measure : tensap.Measure, optional
            The measure associated with the basis, by default a DiscreteMeasure.
            Can be a tensap.RandomVector or a tensap.RandomVariable to define
            a random generator and an expectation. The default is None.

        Returns
        -------
        None.
